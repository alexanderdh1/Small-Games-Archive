# UNO (p5.js)

A digital version of the card game UNO developed as a school project using p5.js.

The project implements core game logic, card types, turn handling, and a graphical
interface, but is not fully completed.

## Project status
The following features are implemented:
- Card generation and shuffling
- Player turns and turn direction
- Drawing and placing cards
- Basic rule validation
- Graphical rendering of cards and players

The following features were planned but not completed:
- Skip turn handling
- Deck reshuffling
- Intermediate turn screen
- Color selection after wild cards
- Playing multiple cards in one turn
- “Say UNO” functionality

## Implementation
The project is structured using object-oriented programming with separate classes for:
- Game logic (UNO)
- Players
- Cards
- Graphical user interface

## Context
This project is included as a learning exercise and does not represent
a finished or fully rule-complete UNO implementation.
